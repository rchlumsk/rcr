\title{Normal Depth Calculation}
\usage{
normal_depth(xs, Q, S, options)
}
\arguments{
\item{xs}{cross-section of object class xsection}

\item{Q}{flow value through cross-section (m3/s)}

\item{S}{bed slope in cross-section, typically supplied as part of a boundary condition}

\item{options}{object of class rcr_options with options and constants for hydraulic calculations}
}
\value{
\item{WSL}{Water surface elevation}

The Manning's n used in the calculation of the normal depth is calculated as a composite Manning's n,
weighted using the wetted pereimeter of the left overbank, main channel, and right overbank.
}
